> What Happened to Monday (known in several territories as Seven Sisters) is a 2017 dystopian science-fiction action thriller film directed by Tommy Wirkola and written by Max Botkin and Kerry Williamson. The film stars Noomi Rapace, Glenn Close and Willem Dafoe. What Happened to Monday was released theatrically in Europe and Asia, with Netflix distributing the film in the United States, United Kingdom, and Latin America on August 18, 2017. The film received mixed reviews from critics. 

> The film was originally written for a man, but director Tommy Wirkola had always wanted to work with Noomi Rapace. He pitched the idea of having a female as the main protagonist to producer Raffaella De Laurentiis who agreed to the idea. Wirkola was inspired by films such as Children of Men and Blade Runner due to their realism and world building. The film was shot in Romania over 94 days with a budget of $20 million.

> In a world where families are allowed only one child due to overpopulation, resourceful identical septuplets must avoid governmental execution and dangerous infighting while investigating the disappearance of one of their own.
